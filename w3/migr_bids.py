def migratoryBirds(arr):
    """
    Identify the most frequently sighted bird type, choosing the smallest ID in case of a tie.

    Given a list of integers representing bird type sightings (IDs all in range 1â€“5),
    determine which type appears most often and return its ID. If multiple types share the
    highest frequency, return the lowest ID among them.

    Parameters:
        arr (list[int]): List of bird type IDs sighted.

    Returns:
        int: The ID of the most frequently sighted bird, lowest ID if tie.

    Example:
        >>> migratoryBirds([1, 1, 2, 2, 3])
        1
        (Types 1 and 2 appear twice; return the lower ID: 1.)

        >>> migratoryBirds([3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1])
        1
        (Types 1, 2 and 3 each appear twice; lowest ID is 1.)
