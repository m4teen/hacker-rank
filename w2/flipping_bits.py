def flipping_bits(n):
    """
    Flip every bit of each 32-bit unsigned integer and return the results.

    Given `n_values`, a list of non-negative integers each representing a 32-bit
    unsigned number, this function flips all bits (i.e. every 0→1 and 1→0) in the
    binary representation of each integer, and returns the resulting numbers as
    unsigned integers.

    Parameters:
        n_values (List[int]): List of 32-bit unsigned integers.

    Returns:
        List[int]: Corresponding list of unsigned integers obtained after bit flips.

    Behaviour:
      • Each integer is treated as a 32-bit value.
      • All bits are inverted:
      • The result remains within the unsigned 32-bit domain.
